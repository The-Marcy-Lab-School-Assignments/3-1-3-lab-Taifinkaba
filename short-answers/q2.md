# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The cycle is something that happens between the user and the server. It's how a web browser requests data from a server and the server responds with the requested data. The user submits a form and the form updates certain info and reflects it on the site.

Not quite, the request/response cycle is something that happens between the client and the server, I think you look a bit more into it.
