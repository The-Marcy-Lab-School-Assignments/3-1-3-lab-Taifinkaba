# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. more dynamic for js or css use. By using `type="module"` we can use smaller codes so we don't waste runtime. `modules` can also only run when the function is needed.

2. you know the type of use  it is for. It's also async.
