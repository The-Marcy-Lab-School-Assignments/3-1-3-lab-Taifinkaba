# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
It means use code that the browser and coder can understand later on by being more descriptive. 

```js
//Semantic
<header>
    <h1>Welcome to our Website</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

//Non-Semantic
<div class="header">
    <h1>Welcome to our Website</h1>
    <ul class="navigation">
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
